# The Informer
A VST3/LV2/AU plugin and standalone software that analyzes incoming audio and computes a range of audio descriptors, which are sent as OSC (Open Sound Control) messages. These can be used in other software, such as for sound visualization or real-time audio analysis.
The Informer is compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS. Pre-built binaries will be available soon.
